    "Of course, it's possible to paste in as many galaxies as you want by repeating the steps in step 2 again. Reset the paths (the `INPUT_PATH` is set to the `OUTPUT_PATH` of the previous step, as in section 2 above) and rerun the commands. It probably only makes sense to do this a few times, because if too many galaxies are added the image will get very crowded and it will be hard to add more galaxies without their masks overlapping. We don't allow masks to overlap, so if this happens then the image is automatically excluded from training. Nevertheless, it's perfectly possible to add a few galaxies to each training image."
